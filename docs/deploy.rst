Installing Hashicorp Vault
--------------------------

See `Vault's documentation`_ for detailed instructions.
For a simple development / test installation on *Ubuntu*, this works:

.. code-block:: shell

    version=0.5.3
    curl -sLS "https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/${version}/vault_${version}_linux_amd64.zip" \
        | funzip >/usr/local/bin/vault
    chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/vault
    apt-get install supervisor
    adduser vault --ingroup daemon --home /var/lib/vault --system --disabled-password
    cat >/etc/supervisor/conf.d/vault.conf <<'EOF'
    [program:vault]
    command         = /usr/local/bin/vault server -dev
    user            = vault
    redirect_stderr = True
    autostart       = True
    EOF
    supervisorctl update
    supervisorctl tail -2200 vault

.. warning::

    As mentioned above, this is intended for experimenting with Vault on
    your workstation. Do **NOT** run it this way on anything that is intended
    for production use.


Providing Credentials for Vault
