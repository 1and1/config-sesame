=============================================================================
Installing Config Sesame
=============================================================================

Below you find several different options to install the tool and
*Hashicorp Vault*, and how to connect them.


Installing Into a Python Virtualenv
-----------------------------------

These commands install ``config-sesame`` into its own virtualenv in your home.
It can be easily removed again, since most everything is contained
within the virtualenv's directory.
Also see `Installing Python Software`_ in case your machine lacks *Python*
or tools like ``virtualenv``.

.. code-block:: shell

    #release="config-sesame"
    release="https://github.com/1and1/config-sesame/archive/master.zip#egg=config-sesame"

    # install "config-sesame" to its own virtualenv
    mkdir -p ~/.local/venvs
    test -d ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame \
        || virtualenv ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame
    ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame/bin/pip install -U "$release"
    mkdir ~/bin 2>/dev/null && exec $SHELL -l
    ln -s ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame/bin/config-sesame ~/bin
    config-sesame --version

On *Linux*, if you want to safely store the credentials to access *Vault* in your account's keyring,
execute these additional commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev python-dev libffi-dev build-essential
    ~/.local/venvs/config-sesame/bin/pip install secretstorage dbus-python keyring

See `keyring installation`_ for more details on that.


Installing Hashicorp Vault
--------------------------

See `Vault's documentation`_ for detailed instructions.
For a simple development / test installation on *Ubuntu*,
this works when called in a ``root`` shell:

.. code-block:: shell

    version=0.5.3
    curl -sLS "https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/${version}/vault_${version}_linux_amd64.zip" \
        | funzip >/usr/local/bin/vault
    chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/vault
    apt-get install supervisor
    adduser vault --ingroup daemon --home /var/lib/vault --system --disabled-password
    cat >/etc/supervisor/conf.d/vault.conf <<'EOF'
    [program:vault]
    command         = /usr/local/bin/vault server -dev
    user            = vault
    redirect_stderr = True
    autostart       = True
    EOF
    supervisorctl update
    supervisorctl tail -2200 vault

.. warning::

    As mentioned above, this is intended for experimenting with Vault on
    your workstation. Do **NOT** run it this way on anything that is intended
    for production use.


Providing Credentials for Vault
